The objective of this workshop/course was to get you comfortable enough with the
command line and git to start using it immediately for your own solo projects.

If you want to learn about using GitHub collaboratively, you might like to check

written collaboratively using git on GitHub: https://github.com/karthik/smb_git
* This chapter of Hadley Wickham's book on making R packages:
