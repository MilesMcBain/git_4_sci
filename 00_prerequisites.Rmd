The task here is to get you setup with 3 main components:

  * git - the version control software we will be studying
  * Atom - a text editor with good integration with git/GitHub
  * GitHub Account - access to the famed online git hosting service.

## Git

### Windows

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8)

1. Download the [Git for Windows installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
1. Run the installer and follow the steps bellow:
    1. Click on "Next".
    1. Click on "Next".
    1. Keep **"Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" selected and click on "Next"**. If you forgot to do this programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.
    1. Click on "Next".
    1. **Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" selected and click on "Next".**
    1. **Keep "Use Windows' default console window" selected and click on "Next".**
    1. Click on "Install".
    1. Click on "Finish".
1. If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
    1. Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type `cmd`  and press [Enter])
    1. Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:

    ``` 
    setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"
    ```
    1. Press [Enter], you should see SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.
    1. Quit command prompt by typing exit then pressing [Enter]

This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.

### MacOS

#### Check you can access 'Terminal'
The Terminal can be found in /Applications/Utilities or by searching spotlight for 'Terminal'. You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.

#### Git install option 1
Open the terminal and type:

  ```
  $ git --version
  ```
  
If git is not installed you will get a prompt asking you if you wish to install it along with Xcode command line tools. You may be asked for your administrator password.

#### Git install option 2
Download and run the installer from: https://git-scm.com/download/mac. Hit
'Continue' through the prompts without modifying the installation destination or
other settings. You may be asked for your administrator password.

### Linux
Check you have git installed by opening your terminal and running:

  ```
  $git --version
  ```

If git is missing install is using your package manager. E.g. by running

  ```

  ```

In the terminal.
