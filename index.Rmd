# About this

This is a short course designed to get researchers up and going with git and
GitHub. It acknowledges git is fundamentally a command line tool and so tries to
teach the minimum cli knowledge necessary to be git effectively.

Focus is on solo workflow using GitHub as a remote repository, although tools
are taught that should allow the user participate in git-based collaboration
without too much pain.
