## Questions
* How can I create a git repository on GitHub for my work?
* How can I keep my work private if need be?
* How can I get a copy of the repository I can modify on my computer?

## Objectives
* Understand options for creating a repository on GitHub. 
* Understand how to clone a local copy repository from GitHub.

## Git vs GitHub

Git is called a 'distributed version control system'. The contrast to this is a
Centralised Version Constrol System (CVS) e.g. Google Docs. Git is distributed
in the sense that although it can be used to syncronise changes to a repository,
it does not require a 'single source of truth' to do that. File changes can be
shared in networks of peers with any topology.

Git was developed for the Linux Kernel project which has a structure reminiscent
of a military. A supreme commander accepts code changes from a few trusted
generals, who in turn accept code changes from a few trusted lieutenants and so
on. This would not be possible with a centralised model.

GitHub hosts git repositories, that act as central repositories that users
synchronise with. But even this mode is more flexible than a traditional
centralised approach. Users can use git locally to manage committed changes
before 'pushing' them to GitHub. E.g. remove or amend commits.

GitHub also introduces the concept of 'forking' whereby users can create a fork
of another user's GitHub repository, sync changes with the fork, and eventually propose
changes be pulled from the fork by the original repository. Forks can themselves
be forked, which allows for a complex topologies within repositories hosted on
GitHub.

In summary git is the program that creates repositories and powers the version
control, and git provides cloud hosting for git repositories with additional
website features that facilitate collaboration.

## Creating a hosted repository on GitHub

There are a number of ways to set up a local repository that is syncronised with
GitHub. In this lesson we will use the 'GitHub first' approach described by
[@Bryan2018-le]. At a high level the workflow for this approach looks like:

1. Create repository on https://www.github.com
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your PC, making a 'local copy'.
1. Commit changes to local copy and push to GitHub.

## To Teach
* Creating a repository using the GitHub GUI
  - private vs public
  - naming and description
  - README
* `git clone`
