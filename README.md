# Git for Scientists

This course was developed as a 3.5 hour introduction to basic shell and
git/GitHub workflow for ACMES researchers, and delivered at the 2018 ACEMS
retreat.

# Premise

This course takes about 1/3 of the time to teach basic shell usage, before
moving on to git and GitHub. The focus is on creating comfort, and exercises are
given regularly, in the Software Carpentry style. The end goal is to use git as
a command line tool in a solo workflow, syncing a project with GitHub.
